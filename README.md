# Triangle Tracker
#### This application accepts user input in form of trianlge sides and gives feedback on the type of triangle, or if it's not a triangle., 02/2019
#### By **Ian Jaccojwang**
## Description
The user inputs the length of 'suspected' triangle sides. Those lengths are then analysed to determine whether the sides form a triangle or not. If they form a triangle, it gives the type of triangle: either equilateral, scalene or isosceles.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Go to the deployed site on:
* Enter the three lengths you would like to test.
* Submit the values and wait for your result.
## Future Improvemnts
In future, I would like the program to draw out the actual triangles to scale then display the angles and sides of the triangle.
## Technologies Used
